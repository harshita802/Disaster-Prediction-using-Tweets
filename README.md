# Disaster-Prediction-using-Tweets

## Disaster Prediction Using Tweets
This GitHub repository presents a comprehensive approach to disaster prediction using tweets. Leveraging various deep learning models, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional RNN, CNN, TensorFlow Hub Pretrained Sentence Encoder, TensorFlow Hub Pretrained USE, and a Simple Dense model, this project aims to harness the power of natural language processing for predicting disasters through social media data.

## Features
Model Diversity: Multiple deep learning models are implemented, allowing users to experiment and choose the model that best fits their requirements.

TensorFlow Hub Integration: TensorFlow Hub Pretrained Sentence Encoder and TensorFlow Hub Pretrained USE models enhance the efficiency of text processing and feature extraction.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Python: Ensure Python is installed on your system. Download it from python.org.

## Model Customization
Model Selection: Choose the most suitable model from the implemented LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional RNN, CNN, TensorFlow Hub Pretrained Sentence Encoder, TensorFlow Hub Pretrained USE, or Simple Dense models.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust hyperparameters in the script for optimal performance based on your specific use case.
